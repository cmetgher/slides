		<h2>What is Computational Social Science?</h2>
		<blockquote>
		Computational Social Science is the interdisciplinary science of <code>complex social systems</code> and their investigation through computational modeling and related techniques.
		</blockquote>
		<ul>
<li>aims to understand, model and predict individual behavior
</li>
<li>applies to many scales: cells, individual, families, groups, societies, etc.</li>
		</ul>

<p>Computational modeling was used to shed light on a wide range of complex human and social systems</p>

<li>What happens over years as some individuals become obese? Do their close relaionships also become obese?

<h2>Why does it matter?</h2>
<ul style="

">
<li>Network phenomena appear relevant to the bio-behavioral trait of obesity</li>
<li>Obesity appears to spread across social ties, a finding with potentially  implications for clinical and public health interventions</li>
<li>Weight status can largely be attributed to social norms</li>
</ul>

<i>Potential mechanisms:</i>
<ul>

	<li>"Let's go have pizza and muffins together"</li>
	<li>Your friends start gaining weight and your idea of acceptable body size changes</li>

<li>strong correlation between local demographic characteristics and pandemic severity, which gives rise to previously unanticipated spatial pandemic hotspots</li>
<li>The average household size in a census tract is strongly correlated with the clinical attack rate computed by the simulation</li>

<section class="slide"><div>
<h2>Understanding global disease dynamics has become a major 21st-century challenge</h2>
<ul>
<li>Complexity of global human mobility, particularly air traffic</li>
<li>Geographic distance in a globally connected world is no longer a good indicator of how “far” locations are effectively separated from one another</li>
<li>New effective distance</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:19px">For example more people travel each day between London and New York than e.g. London and some small town in the UK. So would it not make sense to think of London and New York as being close neighbors and London and a small town in the UK be far apart? </p>

<h2>The hidden patterns in complex global disease dynamics</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ECJ2DdPhMxI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p style="font-size:14px">The clip above is a simulation of a hypothetical epidemic, similar in characteristics to the 2009 swine flu pandemic, on the worldwide air transportation network (approx. 4000 nodes and 2500 links) with a hypothetical outbreak in Atlanta. A qualitative characteristic is that the pattern very quickly becomes irregular, no apparent wavefront exists and it is very difficult to predict arrival times at chosen nodes at the network.</p>
	</div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
	<div>
<h2>Why does it matter?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Complex spatiotemporal patterns can be reduced to surprisingly simple homogeneous patterns</li>
<li>Effective distance reliably predicts disease arrival times</li>
<li>Starting point for more detailed investigations: the spreading speed</li>
<li>The successful application to real epidemic data suggests that our method is also of practical use (H1N1 pandemic in 2009) </li>

<h2>Weekly Rhythms in Smoking Cessation
Considerations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Popular belief has been that the decision to quit smoking is unpredictable or even chaotic</li>

<li>The authors examined Google cessation query trends in English, French, Mandarin, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish(2008 - 2012)</li>
<li>Queries including “quit” and “smoking” (eg, “quit smoking help”) were combined into a single trend - this was repeated for “arrêter de fumer,” “parar de fumar,” “бросить курить,” and “dejar de fumar.”</li>
<li>Monday query volumes were 25% (95%CI) higher than the combined Tuesday through Sunday mean for all languages.</li>

</ul>

</div></section>



<section class="slide"><div>
<h2>Why does it matter?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>"Forget the New Year's -- Monday is the day to quit!"</li>
<li>Public health campaigns on smoking cessation could direct their resources — time, staffing, money — earlier in the week, when they might get best results </li>
<li>The research could revolutionize the way that health officials think of helping the estimated 1 billion smokers worldwide</li>

<h2>Agent-based modeling for humanitarian issues: disease and refugee camps</h2>

<li>Authors model agents as dynamic and purposeful individuals engaging in daily activities</li>
<li> All are susceptible to diseases</li>

<li>- the spread of cholera grows radically from contaminated water sources and highlight the potential of agent based modeling to explore the spread of cholera in a humanitarian context</li>

<h2>Why does it matter?</h2>
<ul>
<li>This modeling effort highlights the potential of 
agent based modeling to explore the spread of cholera in a humanitarian context</li>
<li>Impact on service provision</li>
<li>The model shows that agents who are exposed to 
contaminated water are very susceptible to cholera infection</li>
<li>The agents are also 
some of the causes of the epidemic when they use open field latrines</li>
<li>Cholera cases were identified in a place where water sources were relatively safe
<ul style="font-size:15px">
<li>
This was due to runoff caused by rain and as agents were travelling throughout the camps to visit their friends and relatives.
